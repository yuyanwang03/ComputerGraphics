## Lab1

Just after running the program, it will only react to keyboard types of numbers 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5. Each of them corresponds to an assignment section (section3.1, section3.2, section3.3, section3.4 and section3.5 respectively).

The program is set by default to initialize itself in section 1.

### Key number 1 (SDLK_1)

### Key number 2 (SDLK_2)

### Key number 3 (SDLK_3)

### Key number 4 (SDLK_4)
